            <h3>OpenAI’s mission is to ensure that artificial general intelligence (AGI)—by which we mean highly autonomous systems that outperform humans at most economically valuable work—benefits all of humanity.</h3>
            <h3>We will attempt to directly build safe and beneficial AGI, but will also consider our mission fulfilled if our work aids others to achieve this outcome.</h3>
         </div>
            <p><h2>Broadly Distributed Benefits</h2>
            <ul><li>We commit to use any influence we obtain over AGI’s deployment to ensure it is used for 
                the benefit of all, and to avoid enabling uses of AI or AGI that harm humanity or unduly concentrate power.</li>

<li>Our primary fiduciary duty is to humanity. We anticipate needing to marshal substantial resources to fulfill our mission, 
but will always diligently act to minimize conflicts of interest among our employees and stakeholders that could compromise broad benefit.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Long-Term Safety</h2>
<ul>
    <li>We are committed to doing the research required to make AGI safe, and to driving the broad adoption of such research across the AI community.</li>
<li>We are concerned about late-stage AGI development becoming a competitive race without time for adequate safety precautions. Therefore, if a
     value-aligned, safety-conscious project comes close to building AGI before we do, we commit to stop competing with and start assisting this project. 
     We will work out specifics in case-by-case agreements, but a typical triggering condition might be “a better-than-even chance of success in the next two years.”
</li>
</ul>
